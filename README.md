2. Health Monitor 
3. Nutrition and Exercise 

**1. Menstruation Cycles:**
The main features are:

**2. Health Monitor:**

  2. Monitor Additional Health Data: Since this app tries to include women of all ages, regular health data like blood pressure, blood glucose can also be monitored.
  3. Irregularity Detection: Detect in case there is an anomaly in the health data. 
  For irregularity detection, currently the history and the data from patients with same age is taken, and some limits are set on the basis of standard deviation. 
  More advanced ML techniques like outlier detection can also be used for the same. 
  
 **3. Nutrition and Fitness:**
The main features are:
  1. Reciped Ideas
  2. Different Exercise Routines
  3. Personalised Exercise and Workout Routines
 
 Some Challenges and future add-ons: 
 1. For gender verification, some steps can be applied like using a 3rd party government authentication and  real-time verification using image processing
 2. For monitoring health data, data from other health apps can be leveraged.
